# Eclipse Foundation

This GitHub org contains repositories of Eclipse projects.

Many Eclipse projects have a dedicated GitHub organisation (e.g. https://github.com/eclipse-platform/ for the Eclipse Platform project).

An overview of dedicated GitHub organisations can be found here: https://otterdog.eclipse.org/allprojects (please note that this list is still incomplete, but it will eventually contain all Eclipse projects that are hosted on GitHub).

Eclipse projects and their project resources can also be explored here: https://projects.eclipse.org

## Community
All Eclipse projects obey governance rules described in the [Eclipse Development Process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/) to guarantee meritocracry, diversity, vendor-neutrality and business-friendliness.

## Code of Conduct
ü§ù All Eclipse projects are governed by the Eclipse Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eclipse/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior to conduct@eclipse-foundation.org.
