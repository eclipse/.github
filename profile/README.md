# Eclipse Foundation

This GitHub org contains repositories of Eclipse projects.

Many Eclipse projects have a dedicated GitHub organisation (e.g. https://github.com/eclipse-platform/ for the Eclipse Platform project).

We will add a list of all dedicated GitHub organisations soon.

## Community
All Eclipse projects obey governance rules described in the [Eclipse Development Process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/) to guarantee meritocracry, diversity, vendor-neutrality and business-friendliness.
